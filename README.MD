# Virtual Machine

## Why?
I started this project to learn how CPU is really works.

## Why Ruby?
I want to get deeper into InfoSec.
Metasploit framework written in Ruby.
So I choose Ruby to become familiar with it. 
So, just it :)

## Out Of Scope:
Code Issues
* [ ] Ruby Classes Autoload
* [ ] Get rid of Nasty # frozen_string_literal: true  
* [ ] Refactor weird ./alu/replicate.rb implementation
  
Farther Developmennt
* [ ] DIV, MUL, etc. instructions for ALU
* [ ] Real life electronic circuit
